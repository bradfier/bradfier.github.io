title: A first try

This is (for now) just a quick test to make sure my GitHub pages are all working correctly.

I don't imagine for a minute that anyone is going to pay attention to
my terrible Lanyon based GitHub blog, but it will at least allow me
to have somewhere to put my notes about Rust, Scala, Linux, and all the random
stuff that I seem to spend every day learning.
